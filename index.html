            <article>
                <p>Django makes it very easy to set up your own computer so that you can start developing web applications. This section
                explains what you get with the development environment, and provides an overview of some of your setup and configuration
                options. The remainder of the article explains the recommended method of installing the Django development environment
                on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows, and how you can test it.

        <header>What is the Django development environment?</header>
        <article>
            <p>The development environment is an installation of Django on your local computer that you can use for
            developing and testing Django apps prior to deploying them to a production environment.</p>
            <p>The main tools that Django itself provides are a set of Python scripts for creating and working with
            Django projects, along with a simple development webserver that you can use to test local (i.e. on your
            computer, not on an external web server) Django web applications on your computer's web browser.</p>
            <p>There are other peripheral tools, which form part of the development environment, that we won't be
            covering here. These include things like a text editor or IDE for editing code, and a source control
            management tool like Git for safely managing different versions of your code. We are assuming that
            you've already got a text editor installed.</p>

            <header>What are the Django setup options?</header>
            <article>
                <p>Django is extremely flexible in terms of how and where it can be installed and configured. Django can be:</p>
                    <li>Installed on different operating systems.</li>
                    <li>Installed from source, from the Python Package Index (PyPi) and in many cases from the host
                        computer's package manager application.</li>
                    <li>Configured to use one of several databases, which may also need to be separately installed and
                        configured.</li>
                    <li>Run in the main system Python environment or within separate Python virtual environments.</li>

                <p>Each of these options requires slightly different configuration and setup. The following subsections
                    explain some of your choices. For the rest of the article we'll show you how to setup Django on a
                    small number of operating systems, and that setup will be assumed throughout the rest of this
                    module.</p>

                <p>Django web applications can be run on almost any machine that can run the Python 3 programming
                    language: Windows, macOS, Linux/Unix, Solaris, to name just a few. Almost any computer should have
                    the necessary performance to run Django during development.</p>
                <p>In this article, we'll provide instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux/Unix.</p>

            <header>What version of Python should be used?</header>
            <article>
                <p>We recommend that you use the most recent version available â€” at time of writing this is Python 3.7.2
                </p>
                <p>Python 3.5 or later can be used if needed (Python 3.5 support will be dropped in future releases).
                </p>
                <p>Note: Python 2.7 cannot be used with Django 2.1 (The Django 1.11.x series is the last to support
                    Python 2.7).</p>

            <header>Where can we download Django?</header>
            <article>
                <p>There are three places to download Django:</p>
                <li>The Python Package Repository (PyPi), using the pip tool. This is the best way to get the latest
                    stable version of Django.</li>
                <li>Use a version from your computer's package manager. Distributions of Django that are bundled with
                    operating systems offer a familiar installation mechanism. Note however that the packaged version
                    may be quite old, and can only be installed into the system Python environment (which may not be
                    what you want).</li>
                <li>Install from source. You can get and install the latest bleeding-edge version of Django from source.
                    This is not recommended for beginners but is needed when you're ready to start contributing back to
                    Django itself.</li>

                <p>This article shows how to install Django from PyPi, in order to get the latest stable version.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Which_database?">
            <header>Which database?</header>
            <article>
                <p>Django supports four main databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite), and there are community
                    libraries that provide varying levels of support for other popular SQL and NoSQL databases. We
                    recommend that you select the same database for both production and development (although Django
                    abstracts many of the database differences using its Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), there are still
                    potential issues that are better to avoid).</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>For this article (and most of this module) we will be using the SQLite database, which stores its
                    data in a file. SQLite is intended for use as a lightweight database and canâ€™t support a high level
                    of concurrency. It is, however, an excellent choice for applications that are primarily read-only.
                </p>
                <p>Note: Django is configured to use SQLite by default when you start your website project using the
                    standard tools (django-admin). It's a great choice when you're getting started because it requires
                    no additional configuration or setup. </p>

            <header>Installing system-wide or in a Python virtual environment?</header>
            <article>
                <p>When you install Python3 you get a single global environment that is shared by all Python3 code.
                    While you can install whatever Python packages you like in the environment, you can only install one
                    particular version of each package at a time.</p>
                <p>Note: Python applications installed into the global environment can potentially conflict with each
                    other (i.e. if they depend on different versions of the same package). </p>
                <p>If you install Django into the default/global environment then you will only be able to target one
                    version of Django on the computer. This can be a problem if you want to create new websites (using
                    the latest version of Django) while still maintaining websites that rely on older versions.</p>
                <p>As a result, experienced Python/Django developers typically run Python apps within independent Python
                    virtual environments. This enables multiple different Django environments on a single computer. The
                    Django developer team itself recommends that you use Python virtual environments!</p>
                <p>This module assumes that you've installed Django into a virtual environment, and we'll show you how
                    below.</p>

            <header><h4>Installing Python 3</h4></header>
            <article>
                <p>In order to use Django you will have to install Python on your operating system. If you're using
                    Python 3 then you will also need the Python Package Index tool â€” pip3 â€” which is used to manage
                    (install, update, and remove) Python packages/libraries used by Django and your other Python apps.
                </p>
                <p>This section briefly explains how you can check what versions of Python are present, and install new
                    versions as needed, for Ubuntu Linux 18.04, macOS, and Windows 10.</p>
                <p>Note: Depending on your platform, you may also be able to install Python/pip from the operating
                    system's own package manager or via other mechanisms. For most platforms, you can download the
                    required installation files from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install them using the
                    appropriate platform-specific method.</p>

            <header><h5>Ubuntu 18.04</h5></header>
            <article>
            <p>Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS includes Python 3.6.6 by default. You can confirm this by running the following
                command in the bash terminal:</p>
            <p>python3 -V</p>
            <p>Python 3.6.6</p>
            <p>However, the Python Package Index tool you'll need to install packages for Python 3 (including Django) is
                not available by default. You can install pip3 in the bash terminal using:</p>
            <p>sudo apt install python3-pip</p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="macOS">
            <header><h5>macOS</h5></header>
            <article>
            <p>macOS "El Capitan" and other more recent versions do not include Python 3. You can confirm this by
                running the following commands in the bash terminal:</p>
            <p>python3 -V
                -bash: python3: command not found</p>
            <p>You can easily install Python 3 (along with the pip3 tool) from python.org:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Download the required installer:
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/</li>
                    <li>Select the Download Python 3.7.2 button (the exact minor version number may differ).</li>
                </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Locate the file using Finder, and double-click the package file. Following the installation prompts.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>You can now confirm successful installation by checking for the Python 3 as shown below:</p>
            <p>python3 -V</p>
            <p>Python 3.7.2</p>
            <p>You can similarly check that pip3 is installed by listing the available packages:</p>
            <p>pip3 list</p>
